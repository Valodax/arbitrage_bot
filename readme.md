<h1>Basic Arbitrage Bot</h1>

This is a collection of several Python Scripts that utilise the CoingeckoAPI to find real time price deviations in all cryptocurrencies (or specific ones given to the program by the user).

It then generates a statistical summary and presents to the user via a custom Tkinter interface. 

The interface highlights several key properties including the coins with the highest arbitrage return, the exchanges to trade for different returns, and the denominated currencies for the trades.
